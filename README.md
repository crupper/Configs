# Configs

## Description

This repo holds configs for tools I use.
* Neovim `init.vim`
* VS Code `settings.json`

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* In order to use the init.vim, the following is required:
    * neovim, ripgrep, FZF
* For `vs_code_settings.json`, Visual Studio Code and the VsCode-Vim extension are required

### Installing

* At this point these are meant more for reference than for cloning
* I'd recommend copying/pasting from these files and putting them in the right location:
    * e.g. [path-to-file]/init.vim
